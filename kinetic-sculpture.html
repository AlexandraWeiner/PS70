              <h1>Project Background</h1>
              <p>
                On week 3 of class we learned about mechanical design and did a refresher on hand tools. Our task was to use what we learned about electronics to power a kinetic sculpture.
              </p>
            <h1>Creating a kinetic sculpture</h1>
            <br>

              <h3>
                The final product

              <h3>
                The process
              </h3>
              <p>
                I was inspired by this sculpture and wanted to create something visually satisfying that could be left in an office or on a desk. 
              </p>
              <img src="assets/img/portfolio/kinetic/zen.gif" alt="kinetic wall art moving slowly">
              <p>
                In the process of searching etsy and youtube for kinetic sculptures, I found a very aesthetically satisfying set of gears so I tried to replicate them. Learning my lesson from last time, I 3D printed a very small model to test the idea. It's a bit messy, but it gets across the concept: one gear moves and the rest follow.
              </p>
              <img src="assets/img/portfolio/kinetic/test.gif" alt="moving small gears with my hands">
              <p>
                Now understanding that the gears would move together, but needed more precise alignment, I printed a holder to replace the screws. I also wanted to hide the motor, so I 3D cut a box using this <a href="https://en.makercase.com/#/basicbox">handy box file creator</a>. Once I had the box and 3D printed holder with four pegs for each gear, I tried drilling on the top of the box. The tension was too much and the pegs went flying off. I ended up hot glueing them back on, but in the future I would reprint so the structure was more even an stable and aligned. Because the top was not quite aligned, I had to stabilize the rod attached to the motor. 
              </p> 
              <img src="assets/img/portfolio/kinetic/motor.JPG" alt="motor attached to gears">
              <p>
                If you look really closely you can see that a pen casing is holding the rod that spins the gear in place. Again, I used hot glue in way too many places, but it proved the concept! I had to hold the sculpture in place to ensure that the motor did not spin. In the future, there would build a holder for the motor to firmly affix it to the box.
              </p>
              <img src="assets/img/portfolio/kinetic/sculpture.gif" alt="kinetic sculpture moving">
              <p>
              In the end, the sculpture captured the initial idea. Something small and visually satisfying for an office environment.
